# Day 1: Variable and Data Types

## Tasks/Activites
### Activity 1 : Variable Declaration
- **Task 1** : Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console
- **Task 2** : Delclare a variable using `let`, assign it a strring, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2 : Constant Declations
- **Task 3** : Declare a constant/varibale using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console

### Activity 3 : Data Types
- **Task 4** : Declare a variable of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator

### Activity 4 : Reassigning Variables
- **Task 5** : Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5 : Understanding `const` 
- **Task 6** : Declare a variable using `const`, and observe the error.

## Feature Request:
1. Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares and variables of different data types and logs both the values and type of each variable to the console.
2. Reassignment Dema: Write a scirpt tht demonstrates the difference in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignment.

## Achievement:
By the end of these activites, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Understand the different data types in Javascript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understant the concept  of variable reasignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
